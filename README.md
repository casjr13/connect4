# Connect 4

A Node.js console app that my nephew and I are making so he can learn how to program.

# Usage

Run the game using `npm start`.

Two players take turns dropping coins onto the board by typing the column number
and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

# Plans
- [ ] Determine if/when someone wins
- [ ] Introduce a custom CPU player
- [ ] Refactor into a ReactJS application
